# The Midnight Train

## Chapter 1: An Unexpected Journey

Sarah clutched her worn leather suitcase as she stood on the dimly lit platform. The old station clock showed 11:47 PM, and a thick fog rolled in from the harbor, wrapping everything in an eerie silence.

"Is this really happening?" she whispered to herself, her breath visible in the cold night air.

The train doors opened with a soft *hiss*, revealing a warmly lit interior that seemed to belong to another era. Velvet seats, brass fixtures, and the soft glow of gas lamps created an atmosphere of timeless elegance.
