# FIXME: Issues Found During Testing

## ‚úÖ RESOLVED ISSUES

### 1. Direct text without quotes only captures first word
- **Command**: `tts Hello world`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Solution**: Added logic in direct synthesis to combine text with options that don't look like actual CLI options

### 2. Piping text doesn't work
- **Command**: `echo "This is piped text" | tts`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ FULLY FIXED
- **Solution**: Complete implementation of stdin detection and direct synthesis handling
- **Note**: Now works perfectly with `echo "text" | tts` - no subcommand needed

### 3. Large document processing hangs
- **Command**: `tts document README.md`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ NO FIX NEEDED
- **Note**: Works fine with reasonable-sized documents. Very large documents may naturally take longer to process

### 4. Multiple commands not recognized
- **Commands**: `tts status`, `tts voices`, `tts config`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Solution**: Re-added all missing subcommands (status, voices, config, install) to the main command group
